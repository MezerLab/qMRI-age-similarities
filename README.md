# qMRI-age-similarities

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing microstructural changes in the brain during aging using statistical methods and machine learning techniques applied to quantitative MRI (qMRI) data. The project develops a novel multi-parameter method to assess brain region convergence and variability during aging. It leverages data science, machine learning, and statistical methods to uncover insights into brain aging.

## Key Features
- **qMRI Data Processing**: Preprocessing of quantitative MRI data from multiple brain regions for analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Application of advanced algorithms like XGBoost and t-SNE to classify brain regions by age and uncover patterns in brain aging.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Use of statistical methods to explore correlations between brain regions and variability across subjects.
- **Visualization**: Creation of visualizations such as brain region clustering plots and correlation matrices.
